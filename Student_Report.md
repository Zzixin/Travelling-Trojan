## Step1: Autocomplete the location nameï¼š
For this function, we are going to conside the names of nodes as the locations. In the input, we typed in the name prefix of the location, and the output will give us the partial name of the prefix we typed in. Besides, we need to treat the uppercase and lowercase as the same character.

First, we transform the input name and all the location name of data to lowercase. And we set a flag to 1, if the input name size bigger than the location name of data, we change the flag to 0, if not, we go through the location name of data with size of input name. Then, we push back the result to the vector.

**Time complexity:** O(n*name.size()). n represents the number of nodes in the map. The fist for-loop costs O(n) and the second for-loop costs O(name.size()).

eg: if the input name is 'ch', then the time complexity is O(2n)

**Examples and Time taken by function:**

Input: "ch" \
Output: ["ChickfilA", "Chipotle Mexican Grill"]

Input: "cr" \
Output: ["Crosswalk2", "Crosswalk1","Crosswalk3"]

## Step2: Find the place's coordinates in the map:
For this function, the input is the location name. And we want the latitude and longitude of the location name in the output. If the given location does not exist, then return (-1,-1).

First, we find the node of the input location name. Second, we go through the node of data, if the node name is the input location name, then we return the latitude and longitude. If not, we return (-1,-1).

**Time complexity:** O(n*name.size()). n represents the number of nodes in the map. The for-loop costs O(n) and if-statement comparing two strings costs O(name.size()).

**Examples and Time taken by function:**

Input: "ChickfilA" \
Output: (34.0167, -118.283)

## Step3: CalculateShortestPath between two places:
### 1. Dijkstra
We use ```priority_queue``` to implement Dijkstra Algorithm. The input is the names of start locaton and end location. We expect the shortest path between these two locations.

- First, we initialize the unordered_map ```distance```, which records the shortest distance value between the location and the start node. The values of ```distance``` are set to INT_MAX and we assign distance value as 0 for the start node, so that it can be picked first.
- Then we use priority_queue ```q```, which is the min-heap, to record the pair of the shortest distance to the start node and the location id.
- While ```q``` is not empty, we implement edge relaxation. We choose a ```min_node``` with the shortest distance to the start node. Iterate through all the neighbors of ```min_node```, for every neighbor, if the new distance value (go through ```min_node```) is less than the original one, then its distance value will be updated. 
- When implementing edge relaxation, we use unordered_map ```pre``` to record the predecessor of the node. If the distance value of min_node's neighbor is updated, then the predecessor of the neighbor is ```min_node```.
- When ```q``` is empty, we can get the shortest distance tree from the start node to the end node with the help of ```pre```.

**Time complexity:** O((m+n)*logn). m represents the number of edges and n represents the number of nodes.

```while (!q.empty())``` runs n times, and ```q.pop``` costs O(logn). The for-loop ```for (auto &i:neigh)``` totally costs O(m)(there are m edges) and ```q.push()``` costs O(logn). Therefore time complexity of the function is O((m+n)*logn).

### 2. Bellman-Ford
In this section, we implement Bellman-Ford algorithm. 
- First, we initialize a map ```distance``` of size n(n represents the number of nodes) with all distance values from the source to other nodes as infinite(INT_MAX) except the ```dist[start]```, which is 0.
- Then we do edge relaxation for n-1 times, n represents the number of nodes in the map. Because the start node to any other node in the map can have at most n-1 edges. 
- When implementing edge relaxation, we use a map ```pre``` to record the predecessor of the node so that we can get a shortest path tree in the end. And we also set a flag, when there is no change in an edge relaxation, which means the shortest path tree strike a balance, we will break the loop.

**Time complexity:** O(n*m), n represents the number of nodes and m represents the number of edges in the map.

Because we will implement edge relaxations O(n) time and evry edge relaxation costs O(m). Therefor the time complexity if O(n*m).

**Examples and Time taken by function:**

### 3. Runtime compard between Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford
We listed 10 examples to compare the runtime between Dijkstra and Bellman_Ford. 

<p align="center"><img src="img/Student_table1.png"  width="400"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="img/Student_comparedandb.png"  width="400"/></p>

As we can see, the runtime of Dijkstra is less than the Bellman_Ford.


## Step4: The traveling Trojan Problem:
#### 1. Brute force

#### 2. Backtracking
In this section, we implement Backtracking algorithm to solve Traveling Trojan Problem.
**time complexity:** $O(n^2*n!)$


#### 3. 2-opt
**time complexity:** $O(n^3)$


#### 4. Genetic


#### 5. Runtime compard between Brute force, backtracking, 2-opt and Genetic
We listed several examples to compare the runtime between Brute force, backtracking, 2-opt and Genetic.

<p align="center"><img src="img/Student_table2.png"  width="400"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="img/Student_compare.png"  width="400"/></p>

As we can see, the runtime of brute force is much higher than others when the number of nodes get larger.

## Step5: Cycle detection:
For this section, we use a square-shaped subgraph of the original graph by using four corrdinates. And it follows the order of left, right, upper and lower bounds. We are tring to determine if there is a cycle path in that subgraph.

First, we can get the left, right, upper and lower bounds from the ```std::vector<double> square```. Second, we go through the data's latitude and longtitude to see any points are in the square and we push back to vector which named points. We are using DFS for the cycle detection, we need to consider the parent in the cycle detection incase there are two nodes that is detected as a cycle. Then, we use a map with booling named visited, we set every point in points are false. And go through all the points using recursive DFS. Eventually, we plot the path and square out.

## Step6: Topological Sort:
In this section, we are going to find the feasible route according to some dependencies. We mainly use DFS to realize Topological Sort.

- First, we initialize the edge map which contains the node and its neighbors and the mark map which is used to record whether the node has been marked.
- Then we use DFS and mark map to recursivly access every node in ```locations```. Through using DFS, we will get the deepest node first. Therefore, to get the final result, we need to reverse the original result obtained by DFS.

**Time complexity** If m>=n, it's O(m); if n>m, it O(n). m represents the number of edges(the length of ```dependencies```). n represents the number of nodes in ```locations```
Obtaining the edge map costs O(m). The time complexity of DFS is O(n).

**Examples and Time taken by function:**



## Step7: Find K closest points:
For this section, we are going to find the k closest location with the name on the map and return a vector of string ids.

We are using heap for this section. First, we create a priority queue and set the return vector to be the k sizes. Then, we get the location name and the location's latitude and longitude. After that, we calculate the distance and put that in the queue. If the size of queue is equal to k size, then we compare the distance we calculated with the distance in the queue. If the distance we calculated is smaller than the distance in the queue. We replace it with the smallest one.
