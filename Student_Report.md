## Step1: Autocomplete the location nameï¼š
For this function, we are going to conside the names of nodes as the locations. In the input, we typed in the name prefix of the location, and the output will give us the partial name of the prefix we typed in. Besides, we need to treat the uppercase and lowercase as the same character.

First, we transform the input name and all the location name of data to lowercase. And we set a flag to 1, if the input name size bigger than the location name of data, we change the flag to 0, if not, we go through the location name of data with size of input name. Then, we push back the result to the vector.

Time complexity: O(n*input.size()).

eg: if the input is 'ch', then the time complexity is O(2n)

Time spent: 5264 microseconds
